# ANI machine learning potentials for glycine

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook ``DMC.ipynb`` showing how to train and use DMC-certified ANI-type machine learning potentials representing global PES of glycine with [MLatom](http://MLatom.com) (https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom).

Representative models are included in ``models`` directory.

## Notes

The Jupyter notebook uses the the development MLatom version, i.e., currently the notebook using the released MLatom only works for all simulations with ANI potentials except for DMC. MLatom supporting all other required features is under preparation and should be released within March 2024.
