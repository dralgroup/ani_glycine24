# ANI machine learning potentials for glycine

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook ``DMC.ipynb`` showing how to train and use DMC-certified ANI-type machine learning potentials representing global PES of glycine with [MLatom](http://MLatom.com) (https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom), version >= 3.2.0.

Representative models are included in ``models`` directory.
